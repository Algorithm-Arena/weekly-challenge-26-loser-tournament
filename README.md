# Weekly Challenge #26 - Loser Tournament

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that simulates a tournament where the worst players have a chance of winning.** There are so many factors that go into organizing a tournament but one of the most interesting mathematically speaking is the tournament setup, do you do group phases plus single elimination bracket like in the soccer European Championship, do you do double round-robin like in the chess Candidates Tournament? All of them are trying to get the best to win, but what if you wanted to give the highest chance to the lowest performing players, how would the setup be?

### Winners:

* The winner for $75 is @nikpundik by creating a board game where people vote for who is the worst at a topic each round. The worst loser ends up winning in the end. So clever! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-26-loser-tournament/issues/1

* In second place for $50 is @PuttTim! You can find yourself in a situation in Valorant where you are almost lost but clutch a round. Using this to determine the outcome of the tournament helps the losers! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-26-loser-tournament/issues/3

* In third place for $25 is @Krayorn! The easiest way to get the worst person to win is to give them a huge amount of point if they win against somebody higher ELO than them. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-26-loser-tournament/issues/2
